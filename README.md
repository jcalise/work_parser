# Parser for significant other
My SO was having to do a lot of manual work to get data from an API into a format that they could use to easily create reports from. 

I created this parser that took their data file, which was trying to be JSON data but was poorly formated by the API and not useable as JSON, and pulls out the relevant data and converts it into a CSV file that they can use in their Google sheet.
